          <h3>More About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Long time ago when I started my professional carrier I did an apprenticeship as a electrical engineer. After some years of working and studying i completed my degree. I then spend 9 months in the German Army as this was still compulsory at the time. I then worked for 2 years as a electrical senior programing automated home installations and other kind of industrial systems. I decided then I needed a challenge and purchased a flight ticket to Mallorca in Spain to find work on the Yachts a I always had a great passion for it. I became self-employed und worked for all kind of companies that had to do with electrics or mechanics on Yachts. One day I got an offer to work as permanent crewmember on a yacht and took this opportunity. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to work towards a certification that would allow me become a chief engineer on the bigger Yachts. After 12 years of working studying and working I achieve the highest license you can obtain as chief engineer on Yachts. I always had the passion the passion to program things and that sense of achievement to bring something alive or get some to work has become stronger and I had the decided I wanted to build apple apps. I enjoyed it, but felt web development was more my thing. I had then started several courses including Free code camp, Udemy courses, Codecademy. I stumbled across the Carrerfoundry and liked the support option that they provide with an designated Tutor / Mentor. Now Iâ€™m here and hope this course will bring me to the next level.
